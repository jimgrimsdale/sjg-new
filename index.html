			<h3>Driving School Lessons for learner drivers and Driver Improvement Training for fully qualified drivers</h3>

			<p>As an Independent Driving Instructor operating from Chingford, London my main objective is to get learner drivers safe on the roads and confident, not just to get them through the DVSA Driving Test.</p>

			<p>Since becoming a fully approved DVSA Driving Instructor about 10 years ago now I have undertaken further training to give driver improvement training to full car driving licence holders. I am therefore keen to teach experienced drivers the advanced driving system used by the Institute of Advanced Motorists and help them to pass the IAM Advanced Driving Test. This would give them the necessary skills and ability to stay much safer on the roads.</p>

			<p>Driving lessons are given around the areas of North and East London including Barking, Chigwell, Chingford, East Ham, Edmonton, Enfield, Ilford, Leyton, Leytonstone, Loughton, Palmers Green, Tottenham, Walthamstow, Waltham Cross, Wanstead, Woodford, and Wood Green.</p>

			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>As an independent driving instructor I give driving tuition to learner drivers to prepare them for their driving test and beyond. I also do Advance Driver Training for fully qualified drivers.</p>

			<p>I started driving instructing as a career after redundancy at HSBC Bank PLC International Branch, London in April 2002, where I worked in the trade finance section. I began my new career with Johns School of Motoring, a company that also train up Army Personnel, Bus and Lorry Drivers. At John's I soon gained a full book of lessons and at a later stage helped to train up Army personnel to prepare them for their DVSA driving test. I also worked for one of the big national driving schools, which I am contractually not allowed to mention their name, before starting my own driving school under the business name SJG Driving Tuition.</p>

			<p>More recently I did some additional training to give driver improvement training to full licence car drivers. I was also part of the Olympics Better Driving Training Team coaching volunteers to drive BMW Motor Cars, to prepare them to transport important clients to official games venues in a safe, efficient and friendly manner. I cover an area of about 7 miles radius of Chingford where I live with my wife and two young children.</p>

			<h1>Intensive Courses</h1>

			<p>Should you wish a fast track method to passing the driving test why not take an intensive driving course and pass your test in as little as 2 weeks.</p>

			<p>The advantage of an intensive course is that you get continuity of learning. The 36 hour course is recommended for complete beginners and would cover the complete DVSA syllabus. The 50 hour course would suit anyone who wanted to take things at a more relaxed pace or those that wanted to reach a more advanced level and reach the Institute of Advanced Motorists advanced driving standard, with perhaps a view to do the IAM Advanced Driving Test once they have passed their DVSA Driving Test. If you have already had some driving experience you may prefer to do the 20 hour course.</p>

			<p>Those who live towards Central London may like to meet me at Woodford Underground Station on the central line or Chingford Station on the mainline from Liverpool Street, and therefore benefit from doing the full lesson time in the test centre area.</p>
